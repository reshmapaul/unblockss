Glucose monitors and insulin pumps are, effectively, prostheses: artificial organs that are basically parts of your body. Abbott's position is that they own part of your body and you can only use it in ways that don't upset their shareholders. This is an outrageous position. I mean, forget all the bullshit about whether your blood is copyrighted and if so, by whom -- they're saying that your organs are copyrighted works whose usage is subject to the whims of a white-shoe law firm that is prepared to delete your code and send you a bowel-looseningly terrifying legal threat any time you dare to assert your bodily autonomy.<br><br><a target="_blank" href=https://boingboing.net/2019/12/12/they-literally-own-you.html?fbclid=IwAR0s0PTHsMM7V-72LH6BX4c3Uf3Z-LuMgvYMo4YBOC8WvbWYJyzZWwgaL3A>Read on boingboing.net</a>
