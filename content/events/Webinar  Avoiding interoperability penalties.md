twitterDescription: "In April, federal rules aimed at improving health information exchange will take hold following a year-long delay due to COVID-19. The rules are expected to force a culture change across the industry, according to the top federal health IT official, Micky Tripathi. Regulators will closely monitor whether the new regulations make information more easily available to patients, including through patients mobile apps. So, what can you do to make sure that your organization is prepared to implement operational and business responses and not be vulnerable to penalties?"
