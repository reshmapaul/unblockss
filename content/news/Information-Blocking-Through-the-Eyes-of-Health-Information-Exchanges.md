ogTitle: "Information Blocking Through the Eyes of Health Information Exchanges - Health IT Buzz"
ogDescription: "The information blocking regulations at 45 CFR Part 171 began to apply to health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, health information exchanges, and health information networks on April 5, 2021, per ONCs recent interim final rule. That makes now a good time to consider stakeholders views about practices that may constitute information blocking, including the extent to which they exist. Our recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association reports on a survey of health information exchanges (HIEs) perceptions of other stakeholders practices related to information blocking."
