SUMMARY:Welcome! You are invited to join a webinar: NYSHealth Webinar: Supporting Patient and Family Access to Health Information. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email about joining the webinar.
DESCRIPTION:The 21st Century CURES Act, a federal mandate that supports patients&rsquo; access to and control of their medical records, recently went into effect. Health care systems are now required to share clinical notes with patients, free of charge. When patients have access to their own visit notes written by health care providers, they better remember what was discussed during the visit; feel more in control of their care; are more likely to take medications as prescribed; and can share notes with their caregivers.A rapid growth in telemedicinealong with patients increasing desire for their own health care information, such as clinician notes and lab resultsin recent years has been accelerated further by the COVID-19 pandemic. Health system innovators can seize this moment to enhance patient engagement.Please join us for an online discussion with Cait DesRoches, Dr.P.H., Executive Director, OpenNotes and Lauren Bruckner, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Director of the Pediatric General Inpatient Units at the University of Rochester Medical Center to learn more about the strategies health systems are employing to make sharing notes with patients easier and more productive. This 60-minute webinar will feature a discussion followed by audience Q&amp;A.
