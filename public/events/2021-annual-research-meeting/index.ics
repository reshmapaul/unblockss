SUMMARY:2021 Annual Research Meeting 
DESCRIPTION:Event
Leading with evidence in a time of change
Bringing the Health Services Research Community Together Virtually In June 2021, health services researchers, policy analysts, clinicians and community members using evidence and data to transform health and health care will once again convene virtually for the AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting (ARM). An important annual milestone for the community, the ARM is AcademyHealths biggest and most popular meeting of the year, offering an irreplaceable forum for connection, recognition, reflection, learning and professional networking opportunities.
Registration includes access to both the live event (June 14-17, 2021) and all the virtual content until Monday, July 19, 2021.
A Virtual Success in 2020 In 2020, nearly 2,000 individuals came together at our first ever virtual ARM. Attendees benefited from engaging with their peers, sharing diverse perspectives, and highlighting the continued need for timely, evidence-based policies to transform health care.
In 2021, we are improving the virtual ARM experience by: Offering even MORE live and pre-recorded breakout sessions, enjoyed both during the four days of the event and/or on your own time. Providing additional networking activities and creating professional engagement opportunities across the event. Now including AcademyHealth Interest Group (IG), career development, and methods sessions during the live event.. Featured Speakers Presenter
