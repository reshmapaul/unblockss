The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare offers enormous potential for accelerating clinical research and improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that the adoption of AI and the subset of AI known as machine learning (ML) may also increase the risks of negative outcomes for patients and introduce or worsen bias. There is therefore an urgent need for a framework focusing on health impact, fairness, ethics, and equity principles to ensure that AI in healthcare benefits all populations, including groups from underserved and under-represented communities. When standard guidelines are not harmonized or are poorly understood, the potential for distrust of AI is increased among both healthcare providers and patients. Moreover, there is currently an inability to easily assess the robustness of algorithms on relevant data and evaluate the process for health systems developing and deploying AI and machine learning. This report is the result of convening experts from multiple institutions representing healthcare systems, academia, government, and industry, through the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI), to identify and propose solutions to issues that must be addressed in order to enable trustworthy AI in healthcare. Specifically, this work summarizes collective recommendations as a step toward a blueprint for assurance standards on trustworthy AI in healthcare. This blueprint will enable health AI, harmonizing standards and reporting, and educate end users on how to evaluate AI technologies in ways that can drive their responsible adoption. Furthermore, the goal of this blueprint is to facilitate guidelines regarding an ever-evolving landscape of health AI tools to ensure high-quality care, increase trustworthiness among the healthcare community, and meet the needs of patients and providers.
