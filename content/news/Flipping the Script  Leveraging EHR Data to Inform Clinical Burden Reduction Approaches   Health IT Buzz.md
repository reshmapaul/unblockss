ogDescription: "In 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a strategy to reduce regulatory and administrative burden relating to the use of health IT, including electronic health record (EHR) systems. Key burden reduction goals addressed in the report include reducing the amount of time and effort required to record information in EHRs to meet regulatory requirements and improving the usability of EHRs. Transitioning the strategy into actionable steps requires continuous monitoring of the burdens associated with EHR use and identification of specific methods that can optimize EHR use and reduce burden associated with use."
