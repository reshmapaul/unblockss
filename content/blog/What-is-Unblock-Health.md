Unblock Health is a first-in-class patient advocacy tool designed for patients and consumers who are ***determined*** to be empowered in their health care journey and are no longer willing to accept traditional barriers to their information. Unblock Health is armed and ready to address common, real-world, unmet needs patients, their carepartners, and consumers face daily.

Unblock Health is designed to:

- hold healthcare organizations & care providers accountable when they do not release medical records in a timely, HIPAA compliant manner, while carefully tracking the process of interactions needed. Functionality is in place to publicly report both data blocking and HIPAA violators in real-time as well as to celebrate data liberators and access champions in the public domain

- request patient-generated health data (PGHD) from mhealth & digital tech devices and apps.

- request an itemized list of all the places that one’s health information has been "shared" or sold to facilitate transparency and awareness of human data science practices.

- facilitate a digital workflow for the implementation of addendums that may be flagged by patients and carepartners upon review of their medical records and health information.
