On March 6, 2020, HHS released two landmark rules one from CMS and one from ONC that implement interoperability and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. The rules will impact providers, patients, payors and vendors.  

The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule is focused on driving interoperability and patient access to health information by liberating patient data using CMS authority to regulate Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, and Qualified Health Plan issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs).

The ONC Final Rule identifies and finalizes the reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking while establishing new rules to prevent information blocking practices (e.g., anti-competitive behaviors) by healthcare providers, developers of certified health IT technology, health information exchanges, and health information networks.

### On this Answers Media Network and eFax Corporate webinar, we bring two thought leaders to the table to discuss the implications of these two rules including:

Use of FHIR-based APIs for privacy, security and standards  
Patient Access APIs  
Provider Directory API  
Payer-to-Payer Data Exchange  
Improving the Dually Eligible Experience by Increasing the Frequency of Federal-State Data Exchanges  
Public Reporting and Information Blocking  
U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)  
Condition of Participation (CoP)

Admission, Discharge, and Transfer Event Notifications
