A result of travel is carbon dioxide emission, so while we are improving healthcare we are also being detrimental to the planet. HL7 FHIR DevDays wants to help you make a difference and improve our environment! We are partnering with One Tree Planted, an international non-profit organization working with people all over the world, to plant trees in their regions. When you register, you can add a tree to your order. Or two. Or ten. In fact, for every tree that you buy, HL7 will double your impact by buying another! The trees will be planted in Washington state and California. Our goal is to plant 2,000 trees in support of the Million Tree Challenge, which will help reforestation efforts in California. Together we can make a difference! Hotel information Attendees of our conference will need to secure their own room reservations. To avoid longer commute, attendees should secure a reservation located in downtown Cleveland. Some suggestions for hotel booking sites:
