Our health information is becoming more and more accessible. Did you know that there's more to your medical records than just being able to look at them? Here are 20 things you can do with your medical records.

- **Create your personal health record:** Having a copy of your medical records can help you keep track of your health and medical history and make it easier for you to share with your doctor and care team as needed.

- **Share with your doctor:** Your doctors need to know about your health and medical history and current health information in order to provide the best care for you. All your doctors don't have all of your medical information. You can be the quarterback of your care.

- **Transfer to a new doctor:** If you switch doctors or move to a new place, you can take your medical records with you to give to your new doctor. This will help with care coordination, continuity of care, preventing the need for repeating tests, procedures, blood work, etc., and ultimately improve your outcomes and reduce costs of care.

- **Contribute to clinical and health research:** Sometimes medical researchers use people's health information to study diseases and find new treatments. With your permission, your medical information could be used to help others in the future. For example, check out <a href ="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/">the Apple Research app</a>.

- **Get a second opinion:** If you're not sure about a diagnosis or treatment plan, you can take your medical records to another doctor for a second opinion. This can help you make informed decisions about your health.

- **Check for errors:** Reviewing your medical records can help you identify any mistakes or missing information that needs to be corrected. It is your right to request corrections to errors in your records.

- **Shared decision-making:** Understanding your medical history and current health information can help you make informed decisions about your health and well-being in collaboration with your doctor and care team.

- **Support disability claims:** If you need to apply for disability benefits, your medical records can be used to help support your claim to demonstrate medical necessity.

- **Manage chronic conditions:** If you have a chronic condition, your medical records can help you keep track of your treatment, medications, and symptoms over time.

- **Prepare for emergencies:** If you're in an emergency situation, having a copy of your medical records can be important for the medical staff to provide the best care for you.

- **Plan for future medical needs:** Reviewing your medical records can help you identify any health issues that may arise in the future and plan accordingly. This may include screenings when there is a family history of cancer or other hereditary condition.

- **Improve communication with your doctor:** Having a copy of your medical records can help you ask more informed questions and have a more productive conversation with your doctor.

- **Keep track of medications:** Your medical records can help you keep track of the medications you've taken, dosages, and any side effects you experienced.

- **Provide important information during travel:** If you're traveling, having a copy of your medical records can be important in case of an emergency. This can be a great supplement to the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/global-digital-health-partnership/international-patient-summary"> International Patient Summary</a>.

- **Obtain a life insurance policy:** Your medical records can be used to help determine your eligibility for a life insurance policy. Gathering your records yourself and double-checking them to make sure that the information in your records is correct will help to ensure a more accurate assessment and quote.

- **Help with mental health treatment:** If you're seeking mental health treatment, your medical records can help your therapist or doctor understand your history and provide better care.

- **Keep track of immunizations:** Your medical records can help you keep track of your immunizations and make sure you're up-to-date on recommended vaccines.

- **Evaluate risk factors:** Reviewing your medical records can help you identify any risk factors for future health problems and take steps to reduce them.

- **Manage pre-existing conditions:** If you have a pre-existing condition, your medical records can help you keep track of your treatment, medications, and symptoms over time.

- **Provide information for end-of-life planning:** Your medical records can be used to help make informed decisions about your end-of-life care as well as to help with preparing advance directives.
