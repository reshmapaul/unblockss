Did you know that March is National Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Awareness Month?

Check out the formal [announcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/28/a-proclamation-on-national-colorectal-cancer-awareness-month-2023/) by the White House proclaiming March 2023 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.

March 3rd was Dress In Blue Day, one of the many ways to show support for CRC awareness and share the importance of screening with your loved ones, colleagues, and friends. There were many posts on Twitter, LinkedIN, and Facebook celebrating #DressInBlueDay.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends regular screenings for all Americans who are older than 45 or have other risk factors.

Itâ€™s important to not ignore symptoms such as:

- blood in stool

- a change in bowel habits

- stomach pain

- bloating

- persistent cramps

- unexplained weight loss.

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, make sure you see your doctor and that the symptoms are documented in your medical record as well as followed up on.

When was your last colonoscopy? Check your medical records and check to see when your last colonoscopy was. My primary care doctorâ€™s office is a private practice that doesnâ€™t have a patient portal and still uses paper charts. I couldnâ€™t remember how many years itâ€™s been since my last colonoscopy so I called up the office and confirmed itâ€™s been over 5 years. I called the gastroenterologistâ€™s office and scheduled my colonoscopy. Now itâ€™s your turn!
