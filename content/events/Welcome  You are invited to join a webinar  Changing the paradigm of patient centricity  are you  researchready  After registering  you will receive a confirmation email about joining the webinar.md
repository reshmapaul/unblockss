ogDescription: "In the rush to launch solutions to maintain trials during COVID-19 are sponsors at risk for leaving patient input behind? While patient-centricity is an overused term with no real definition, does the current environment allow us the opportunity to rethink how patients are engaged for clinical trials, from trial design to access and participation? Can we create a new more permanent solution where the patient is at the heart of the trial? Join us as a panel of experts who will discuss how this could be done and what the industry should consider, with an actionable plan for implementation."
