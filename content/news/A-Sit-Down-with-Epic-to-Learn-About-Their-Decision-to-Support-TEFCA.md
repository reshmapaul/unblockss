No doubt those of you in the world of health IT and interoperability saw the news that Epic plans to apply to join TEFCA as an inaugural QHIN (Qualified Health Information Network). This is big news for TEFCA since its largely a voluntary effort that isnt pushed by some sort of stimulus money or penalties like many past government efforts.We wanted to learn about Epics decision to apply to be a QHIN, so we sat down with Matt Doyle, Software Development Lead for Interoperability at Epic, to talk about this announcement. He shared Epics view on TEFCA, why they plan to apply to be a QHIN, and the decision to get behind TEFCA. Plus, we ask him how the data differs between Epics 3 main healthcare interoperability efforts: CareEverywhere, Carequality, and now TEFCA.
