ogTitle: "TEFCA Awareness Among Hospitals and Variations Regarding Intent to Participate - Health IT Buzz"
ogDescription: "According to a recent American Hospital Association (AHA) survey, most hospitals know about the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) and, among those, very few plan on sitting out. In February, ONC recognized six organizations that have been accepted for onboarding as Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) under TEFCA. These six candidate QHINs have committed to achieving go-live by the end of 2023. With that date just around the corner, we thought the time was right to better understand awareness and plans to participate in TEFCA among the broader health care delivery system."
