      <description>In a new ruling by Judge James N. O&amp;rsquo;Hara, out of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois establishes that patients may obtain their full electronic medical records. This includes all audit trails, revision history, In Basket Messages, HAIKU photos and videos, and Sticky Notes. This policy change is a huge success for parental rights and it will help to ensure that child abuse investigations are rooted in honest and ethical practices.</description>
