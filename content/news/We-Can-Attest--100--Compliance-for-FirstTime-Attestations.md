To meet the Attestations Condition of Certification, Certified Health IT Developers are required to provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services an attestation of compliance with each of the specified Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements (i.e., Information Blocking, Assurances, Communications, Application Programming Interfaces, and Real World Testing) twice a year.April 1, 2022, marked the opening of the first 30-day attestation window. During this period, Certified Health IT Developers submitted their attestations to ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) using ONCs Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) site. Leading up to the submission window, ONC collaborated with ONC-ACBs and the developer community to register accounts on the CHPL and update Certification Program resources, like our Attestations Fact Sheet and Certification Companion Guides (CCGs). We thank our industry partners for their commitment to reviewing the Certification Program requirements and providing timely attestations.
