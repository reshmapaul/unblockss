The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) resolved three HIPAA right of access cases with three dental practices. The resolutions bring OCRs total number of cases to 41 since it launched the HIPAA Right of Access Initiative in 2019.All three cases underscore the importance and necessity of compliance with the HIPAA Rules, OCR stated in its announcement. In July, OCR announced that it had resolved 11 right of access cases, demonstrating its commitment to making sure that patients have access to their medical records.These right of access three actions send an important message to dental practices of all sizes that are covered by the HIPAA Rules to ensure they are following the law, OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer stated.Patients have a fundamental right under HIPAA to receive their requested medical records, in most cases, within 30 days. I hope that these actions send the message of compliance so that patients do not have to file a complaint with OCR to have their medical records requests fulfilled.
