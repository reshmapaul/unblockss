The healthcare industry has significantly improved thanks to technology. What is on the horizon now that we have entered the world of information sharing? This week's guest, Casey Quinlan, is a journalist, data rights activist, and the author of Amazons bestseller Cancer for Christmas: Making the Most of a Daunting Gift. Casey has a special interest in healthcare healthcare tech and has a big voice in the e-patient community. The World Health Organization tagged her as a patient engagement expert in 2014. Casey is dedicated to putting the patient voice front and center in all conversations related to human health.In this episode, we talk about data access, information sharing, patient preferences, choice, and the importance of not just patient access but ensuring that one's health information is correct.Listen in to hear why it's important to have access to one's data to prepare for informed decisions with one's care team and the importance of having a carepartner in the event you land in the hospital and can't navigate your care.Want to know what's really broken with patient access? Buckle in as we talk about consent, data that's held in EHRs, and the health data economy, and data de-indentification business as usual. Don't miss what Casey would do if she was a hospital administrator to make health care a better place for patients and their families!
