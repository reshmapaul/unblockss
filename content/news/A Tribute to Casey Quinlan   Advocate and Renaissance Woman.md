ogDescription: "On Tuesday April 25th 2023, the world lost a bright flame. After a long journey with cancer, Casey Quinlan @MightyCasey passed away peacefully with family and friends by her side. Quinlan was one-of-a-kind and if you had the good fortune of meeting her in-person or interacted with her online, she undoubtedly left an impression. She was one of the few people who had zero qualms about speaking her mind  and that is one of reasons why I admired her."
