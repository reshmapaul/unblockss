The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement is now available. Within the health information technology (health IT) world, few things have been as elusive as a governance framework for nationwide health information exchange. When ONC was formed in 2004, the concept of a nationwide health information networkwhere your information could be located across the country in a clickwas a big picture vision that drove the federal governments early health IT infrastructure, standards, policy actions, and investments.Whats followed as a result of two laws (HITECH Act and 21st Century Cures Act) and remarkable continuity across four administrations has been steady growth, maturity, and investment from both the public and private sectors. Most health care providers use electronic health records.1,2,3 Many are connected to and engage in at least one form of electronic health information exchange.4,5,6 And health information networks are now dotted across the US map supporting communities with a wide range of services.7Todays milestone marks the beginning of a new era of electronic health information exchange in the US. That world we wanted to see back in 2004its hereand now its time to put what weve built to use.Our goals for the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) are:Goal 1: Establish a universal policy and technical floor for nationwide interoperability.Goal 2: Simplify connectivity for organizations to securely exchange information to improve patient care, enhance the welfare of populations, and generate health care value.Goal 3: Enable individuals to gather their health care information.
