The OpenNotes Drop-In Clinic comes at a time when U.S. healthcare professionals are preparing for a federal mandate requiring medical record transparency and open notes. With a projected start date of April 5, 2021, the program rule on [Interoperability, Information Blocking, and ONC Health IT Certification](https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/)which implements the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/selected-amendments-fdc-act/21st-century-cures-act) passed by a bi-partisan Congress in 2016requires healthcare providers to give access to all the health information in their electronic medical records. The rule mandates that patients will be able to access their progress notes rapidly and conveniently in electronic formats.

OpenNotes has been studying the effects of open and transparent communication on patients, care partners and clinicians for over 10 years, and has helped [more than 260 organizations](https://www.opennotes.org/news/new-survey-data-reveals-54-million-people-are-able-to-access-clinicians-visit-notes-online/) transition to practicing in an open notes environment.

In response to a rise in web traffic and general increase in questions, OpenNotes retooled its website over the last few months. OpenNotes.org includes quick answers to some of the most commonly asked questions [by health professionals](https://www.opennotes.org/effects-of-opennotes-faqs/) and [patients](https://www.opennotes.org/reading-your-notes-faqs-for-patients/), an [overview on how the Cures Rule applies to open notes](https://www.opennotes.org/onc-federal-rule/), and a new [OpenNotes Research search tool](https://www.opennotes.org/research/).
