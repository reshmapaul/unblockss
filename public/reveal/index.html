							<p>89 year old Anne discovered that a new
eye doctor's office had wrongly charted
her as diabetic, which led the doctor to
wrongly order surgery.</p>
<p>It would have caused immense family
stress, time in caregiving, risk, and
needless expense. But she caught it.</P>

replacement, her caregiver daughters spotted a
transcription error (hyper &harr; hypothyroid) and
got it fixed, preventing a disastrous mistake by
some physician who would have been obeying
bad chart data. Patient access saved the day.</P>

She rigorously checks to see that the allergy
is listed in every new provider's chart.
It often isn't. She fears an unexpected ER

							<p>When Morgan went to college and moved
hospitals, she brought the protocol she'd
developed for years with her doctor after she got
meningitis (painful and harmful) as a side effect of
her treatment.</p>
<p>By showing her new doctor the written plan, she
was able to advocate for herself and get the right
treatments, avoiding recurrence (and costs) of
meningitis.</P>

<p style="font-size:26px !important;">Some people may want results delivered via clinician verbally but for Casey, getting results as soon as they are available is her choice. Casey says, "Preferences of the patient are the primary priority." </p>
