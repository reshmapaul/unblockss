      <description>Glucose monitors and insulin pumps are, effectively, prostheses: artificial organs that are basically parts of your body. Abbott&amp;rsquo;s position is that they own part of your body and you can only use it in ways that don&amp;rsquo;t upset their shareholders. This is an outrageous position. I mean, forget all the bullshit about whether your blood is copyrighted and if so, by whom &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re saying that your organs are copyrighted works whose usage is subject to the whims of a white-shoe law firm that is prepared to delete your code and send you a bowel-looseningly terrifying legal threat any time you dare to assert your bodily autonomy.</description>
