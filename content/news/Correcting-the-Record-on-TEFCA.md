In the world of health data exchange, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) represents a major step forward in setting a universal floor for interoperability. With this framework, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) is creating the rules of the road that will allow providers, patients, and other stakeholders to securely access privacy-protected health information from a national network of sources in near real-time.

However, like any transformative initiative, TEFCA has faced its share of criticisms, some worthy of discussion but others entirely misguided. Given that TEFCA will ultimately govern how the vast majority of health data is exchanged, we felt it was necessary to correct the record with facts and evidence. With a government-sponsored initiative as wide reaching as this one, we need to separate fact from fiction, and address some of the misconceptions surrounding TEFCA.fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
