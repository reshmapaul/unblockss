SUMMARY:Open Oncology Notes:Research &amp; Real-World ExperienceWebinar &amp; Office Hours: March 8 &amp; March 11
DESCRIPTION:
February 19, 2021
Starting this spring U.S. patients will have access to all of their inpatient and ambulatory visit clinical notes (open notes). As the result of a federal information sharing mandate, once clinical notes are signed by a clinician, patients will be able to read them via their online patient portals. In the practice of oncology, this kind of transparency and immediate access to information may represent a culture change for health care providers, patients, and their care partners.
In this webinar and companion office hours session, Bertram Yuh, MD (City of Hope National Cancer Center) and Everett Weiss, MD (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) will share their experiences practicing in an open notes environment. Dr. Yuh will explore patient vs. oncology clinician views of open notes, and what it was like to launch inpatient and outpatient open notes at the same time within a cancer center. Dr. Weiss will present a case study about sharing open notes at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, including the work to involve patient/family advisory councils in community messaging. He will also share his current efforts to nurture an open notes environment at Memorial Sloan Kettering.
Kicking off the webinar is Rosie Bartel, a patient advocate and educator. Rosie will share about her experience as a patient who reads open notes, and how access to her husbands oncology notes guided her family through difficult healthcare decisions.
