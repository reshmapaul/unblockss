      <description>From what I see in the market, we need to rise to the occasion to assure consumers/patients that their privacy will be respected or we wont realize the full value of digital health as it relates to behavior change. What do you think it will take? A digital health version of the Hippocratic Oath? Is data privacy a potential competitive advantage in building brand and an organizations reputation? How do we achieve transparency about how personal health data is collected and used?</description>
