Happy New Year 2020! With a new year and new decade upon us, we’d like to tell you the story of how Unblock Health was born.

Once upon a time, at HIT Expo 2018 in sunny New Orleans, a board-certified patient advocate and a health IT thought leader got to talking about patient unmet needs. The advocate fervently emphasized the struggles patients and their loved ones faced due to lack of interoperability, rampant data blocking, and little to no transparency while trying to navigate their life-altering diagnoses. The health IT thought leader emphasized the intricacies and challenges the IT community faced in delivering solutions. They both agreed that the sooner patients recognized that no one was coming to save them, the better off they would be. But once that realization came to fruition, how could patients be equipped with tools and strategies to stand a chance against the well-known barriers ahead?
 
Unblock Health is the culmination of over 20 years of boots-on-the-ground patient advocacy experience perfectly complemented with 30 years of leadership in digital tech, strategy, architecture, and engineering expertise to deliver an easy-to-use solution for the most neglected stakeholders in our health care ecosystem: the patient and their carepartner.

***Patients need specific tools to drill through the barriers of data blocking.***

We’ve personally and professionally witnessed the devastating, multi-faceted struggles people face while managing their care in the midst of a life-altering diagnosis. We’ve listened to patients’ frustrations and witnessed the barriers they face in accessing their data. We’ve heard patients demands for transparency and watched them be completely ignored. We know first-hand the grief, loss, anxiety, and distrust that stems from data blocking. 

**We have vowed to not stand back silently, powerlessly, and helplessly a moment longer.**
