OCR has reviewed the complaint and determined that, as a recipient of HHS funds, Pennsylvania is required to comply with the civil rights statutes listed above. OCR has been in communication with PDH, which has agreed to accept technical assistance from OCR and has revised its CSC Guidelines by:removing criteria that automatically deprioritized persons on the basis of particular disabilities,requiring individualized assessments based on the best available, relevant, and objective medical evidence to support triaging decisions, andensuring that no one is denied care based on stereotypes, assessments of quality of life, or judgments about a persons worth based on the presence or absence of disabilities.
