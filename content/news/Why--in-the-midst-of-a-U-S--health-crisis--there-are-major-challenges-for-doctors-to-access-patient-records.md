Heres a small sampling of the problems caused by the lack of interoperability. All of that adds complexity and cost to an already overburdened health-care system.Physicians often find themselves ordering duplicate tests, which is a hassle for patients and a major source of unnecessary costs.Patients might see delays in care as their doctors try to aggregate their medical information.It keeps patients feeling captive in a system, because its a burden for them to go to another hospital that uses a different medical record system.Electronic health record vendors can also charge more to their clients, namely in the form of fees and services.It burdens physicians, who should be concerned with treating their patients.
