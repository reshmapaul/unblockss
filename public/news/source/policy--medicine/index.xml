      <description>On October 6, 2022, information blocking regulations went into effect, despite providers pleas to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to delay the deadline by a year. Request for Delay Some of the groups asking for the delay included the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Health Care Association, American Hospital Association, and the American Medical Association. The providers noted that based upon feedback from our members that continues to build, it is evident that both healthcare providers, clinicians and vendors are not fully prepared for the October 6th deadline.</description>
