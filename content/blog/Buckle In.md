When we rung in the New Year, many called the decade upon us the New Roaring 20’s. March 2020 required a seatbelt buckled in tight.

- Coronavirus became a regular part of our daily vocabulary.

- Grocery stores were ransacked, with no toilet paper, hand-sanitizer, cleaning supplies, or essentials in sight.
- Patients considered high-risk, due to multiple comorbidities, disabilities, being immunocompromised, or in active treatment for cancer were filled with the depths of fear and anxiety.

- More and more doctors and nurses became sick caring for the most vulnerable of patients.
- Telemedicine became a necessary lifeline.

The disparities of our healthcare system and the barriers patients face in getting the care they need have never been more self-evident.

The need for patient access to all health information is undeniable.  The need for educating patients about the importance of their medical and health information is indisputable. The need to support hospitals to provide tools to best support patients and their carepartners is of essence.

We at Unblock Health have been busy supporting patients, carepartners, and health systems around the clock during what will forever be noted in history as the pandemic of COVID-19. 

We look forward to sharing our takeaways and experiential learnings throughout April. In the meantime, we wish you all to stay safe, as healthy as possible while practicing social distancing.

If you haven’t done so already, check out our [Patient Impact Stories](https://www.unblock.health/patient-impact-stories/) collection, , also excitedly launched this month, which highlights all the reasons why having access to your health information can be literally a matter of life and death. While you are practicing social distancing, consider submitting your own stories to be added to this dynamic collection!




Yours in Unblocking Health,
