SUMMARY:Health Dev Jam
DESCRIPTION:Data access, consumer APIs, and patient empowerment are the future of health data interoperability. Patient empowerment and data access are key pillars of the proposed Patient Access and Interoperability rule. With the ONC and CMS rules in the final stage of review, the reality of patients getting timely electronic access to their health information to make more informed decisions about their care is here. Health Dev Jam will bring together a community of healthcare developers, innovation leaders, designers, researchers, policymakers, and tech enthusiasts to enable interoperability across an open-source API ecosystem. Learn what different sandboxes are available, connect with the teams that run them, and provide hands-on training around SMART on FHIR and how the various mediums such as EHR and Cloud vendors can host SMART apps. Hear stories of how patient data access has made a difference in care from E-patient Dave and others who will show how data can transform care and even save lives. Finally, learn how to break down the proposed rules and what they will mean for your organization.
