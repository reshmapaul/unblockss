It seems that the definition of a barbarian is anyone who aims to get patient records under the current laws and the explicit direction of the patient. The opposite of barbarians, whoever they may be within the gates of HIPAA, are able to get patient records without consent or accounting for disclosures by asserting Treatment, Payment, or Operations as well as the pretense of de-identification. Meanwhile, these HIPAA non-barbarians are able to sell off the machine learning and other medical science teachings as trade secret intellectual property in the form of computer decision support and other for-profit algorithms. This hospital-led privatization of open medicine will contribute to the next round of US healthcare exceptionalism.And as for the patients, no worries; well just tell them its about patient safety.
