Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to transform healthcare. Clinical decision support (CDS) tools are expected to streamline physician workflows while intelligently personalizing patient care, decreasing physician burden, and enhancing patient care with precision and accuracy.However, patients currently do not have access to their own intelligent summaries or data outputs. While patients do not see documentation in their medical records if their physicians are utilizing CDS outputs to guide their care, they should be able to submit a medical record request to request a copy of the CDS outputs being used at the point of care. Patients need to be granted access to CDS outputs that are used to guide patient care and care coordination. This is a matter of patient safety, transparency, and patients HIPAA Right of Access if the output is being used to make decisions about an individual.It is concerning that many patients are unaware of the range of digital health AI/ML tools that their providers may be leveraging to guide their care. Most patients have no idea these outputs exist and currently have no way to request, inspect, access them, or correct the information depicted if errors exist.
