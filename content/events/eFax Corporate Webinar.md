**February 25, 2021**

Thursday

**9:00 AM to 10:00 AM**

Pacific Time

On December 10, 2020, HHS announced proposed revisions to the HIPAA Privacy Rule that would significantly impact covered entities under HIPAA.  The Proposed Rule is part of HHSs Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care, which seeks to promote value-based care by examining federal regulations that impede efforts among health care providers and health plans to better coordinate care for patients. 

On this Answers Media Network and eFax Corporate webinar, two privacy and security experts will examine key provisions outlined in the rule. They will also discuss what healthcare providers can expect under the new Biden administration including steps to take in preparation for the final rule.

Agenda:
-------

*   Strengthening patients right to access their PHI including provisions addressing EHRs and personal health applications.
*   Clarifies the definition of health care operations.
*   Creates an exception to the minimum necessary standard for individual-level care coordination and case management uses and disclosures.
*   Clarifies Covered Entities abilities to disclose PHI to social service agencies, community-based organizations, home- and community-based services (HCBS) providers and others.
*   Eases the standard that permits covered entities to make certain uses and disclosures of PHI based on their professional judgment.
*   Expands ability of covered entities to disclose PHI to avert a threat to health or safety.
*   Modifies patients written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice of privacy practices (NPP)
*   Permits disclosure to Telecommunications Relay Services communications assistance without a business associate agreement.
