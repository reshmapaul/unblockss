The THCB Gang: Episode 5Apr 15, 2020 0Episode 5 of The THCB Gang is going to be live-streamed Thursday, April 16 at 1pm PT- 4pm ET! 4-6 semi-regular guests drawn from THCB authors and other assorted old friends of mine will shoot the sh\*t about health care business, politics, practice, and tech. It tries to be fun but serious and informative! If you miss it, it will also be preserved as a weekly podcast available on ouriTunes&Spotifychannels.This week, joining me are Deven McGraw (@healthprivacy), Kim Bellard (@kimbbellard), Grace Cordovano (@gracecordovano), Michael Millenson (@MLMillenson), and Dave deBronkhart (@ePatientDave). It will hopefully be a great discussion around how COVID-19 is changing the entire landscape of health care; from policy to practice Matthew Holt
