      <description>From since the formal launch of TEFCA at the HHS event in early December 2023, it’s been exhilarating to watch the first IAS queries become a reality. While the majority of the industry has balked at IAS, a partnership between Health Gorilla, Clear, and Unblock Health is lighting the way.&#xA;Many patients and advocates are asking me:&#xA;What does this really mean for patients? So what? Who cares about a new set of acronyms in healthcare, including TEFCA and IAS?</description>

      <description>The accompanying image was created by DALL-E. &#39;The Missing Code in AI: The Patient Voice.&#39; Generated image. OpenAI, \[1/12/2024\]&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear that the patient and carepartner voice is not diversely represented in the co-creation of AI-powered solutions used in patient care and patient coordination of care.&#xA;Implementation and integration of AI-powered solutions based on assumptions of what innovators, healthcare executives, and providers think patients and their families need to be successful in their care is a red flag for failure.</description>

      <description>If you give a patient a cancer diagnosis, she may request a copy of her medical records. When she gets her medical records, she may pore over them, carefully deciphering their secrets, jotting down notes with a furrowed brow.&#xA;If you present a patient with her medical records, she may begin peppering her doctors with questions about her care. Each question, a step towards understanding, may fuel a desire for a broader perspective and she may seek a second opinion.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk breast cancer screening, access to results in the portal, and AI powered breast cancer detection.&#xA;It was exciting to see my local imaging center offering Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection (EBCD) using Deep Health&amp;rsquo;s SAIGE-Dx, a mammography diagnostic aid software.&#xA;As someone who has a family history of breast cancer and extremely dense breasts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting routine mammograms with ultrasounds since my early 30&amp;rsquo;s. About 10% of women fall into the category of dense breasts, where it is extremely difficult to detect a tumor on a mammogram.</description>

These are stories that are all too frequent and stories that I wish no one needed to tell.</description>

      <description>A recent article published in the Wall Street Journal entitled Raw Medical Test Results Right to Your Inbox Spark Confusion and Concern continues to beat a dead horse. The only thing that is sparking confusion and concern is why we are still debating whether patients can handle their health information as if becoming a patient strips one of being a consenting adult with choices.&#xA;Here are my top four thoughts on this WSJ piece:</description>

      <description>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and other forms of machine learning (AI/ML) in health care has exposed the need for federal coverage and payment policies that promote innovation and protect patient interests. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has moved forward to regulate software as a medical device (SaMD), and the American Medical Association (AMA) has deployed a framework for coding AI/ML in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has yet to establish consistent methods for the coverage and payment of these technologies.</description>

      <description>In the past few months, the FTC has announced case after case involving consumers sensitive health data, alleging violations of both Section 5 of the FTC Act and the FTCs Health Breach Notification Rule. The privacy of health information is top of mind for consumers and so itstop of mind for the FTC. Companies collecting or using health data, listen up. There are a number of key messages from BetterHelp, GoodRx, Premom, Vitagene, and other FTC matters that you need to hear.</description>

      <description>Ensuring patients have access to the information, tools, and technology they need to make informed decisions about their care is one of the apex of my priorities as a practicing board-certified patient advocate.&#xA;Much of the work patient advocates do is aimed at reducing human suffering. Human suffering presents in many forms. Patient Administrative Burden (PAB) is a significant source of patient suffering. PAB causes extensive barriers to care, especially in the context of a life-altering, life-limiting condition.</description>

      <description>According to a recent American Hospital Association (AHA) survey, most hospitals know about the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) and, among those, very few plan on sitting out. In February, ONC recognized six organizations that have been accepted for onboarding as Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) under TEFCA. These six candidate QHINs have committed to achieving go-live by the end of 2023. With that date just around the corner, we thought the time was right to better understand awareness and plans to participate in TEFCA among the broader health care delivery system.</description>

      <description>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare offers enormous potential for accelerating clinical research and improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that the adoption of AI and the subset of AI known as machine learning (ML) may also increase the risks of negative outcomes for patients and introduce or worsen bias. There is therefore an urgent need for a framework focusing on health impact, fairness, ethics, and equity principles to ensure that AI in healthcare benefits all populations, including groups from underserved and under-represented communities.</description>

      <description>It was 11:20 pm.&#xA;I was digging out from traveling, catching up on emails in the stillness of the night.&#xA;A text alert came through. It was from a patient with metastatic cancer that had transferred to a hospice facility that evening. I assumed it was a regular check-in to say goodnight or “all good here.”&#xA;No dice.&#xA;“Do you have my updated list of my meds?”&#xA;How could a patient with advanced cancer that’s been hospitalized for two weeks and transferred to an in-patient hospice facility not have their health information follow them?</description>

Key burden reduction goals addressed in the report include reducing the amount of time and effort required to record information in EHRs to meet regulatory requirements and improving the usability of EHRs. Transitioning the strategy into actionable steps requires continuous monitoring of the burdens associated with EHR use and identification of specific methods that can optimize EHR use and reduce burden associated with use.</description>

      <description>What a difference a day makes. On October 6, 2022, the healthcare and health IT community woke to a new reality one in which electronic health information (EHI) included far more than it did the day before. Why was that so important? Because penalties for information blocking that is, any practice that interferes with access, exchange, or use of electronic health data are tied to the definition of EHI. With many more types of health information specifically included as EHI, organizations regulated under the 21st Century Cures Act are on the hook to respond to requests for that information from individuals, providers, public health agencies, and health information exchanges.</description>

The providers noted that based upon feedback from our members that continues to build, it is evident that both healthcare providers, clinicians and vendors are not fully prepared for the October 6th deadline.</description>

      <description>Consumer choice in health care has been advanced as a pathway for improving the quality and affordability of health care. The idea is that when people have access to full and accurate information about the quality and cost of health insurance plans, physicians, hospitals, and services and appropriate tools for using that information they will be able to choose the best options for themselves and their families.1Patients who have the information and incentives to act on the information, the thinking goes, will choose higher-priced options only if these offer higher quality and make them better off.</description>

      <description>The VA recently offered a program which issued devices to veterans to be able to take part in virtual visits; see the excellent overview from John Lynn. The full OIG report is here: https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-21-02668-182.pdf&#xA;The goal of the program was to bridge the digital divide that existed for many veterans who didn’t have the right device or connectivity to receive virtual care. While the distribution of devices was somewhat successful, program goals had much room for improvement.</description>

Indeed, in reading the ANPR, we couldnt help but wonder whether this is a serious effort to develop a rule or simply a show of activity to address over-hyped expectations.&#xA;Read on adlawaccess.</description>

      <description>Errors in patient medication data are a disaster and safety error waiting to happen, especially in cases where there are multiple comorbidities, chronic illness, life-altering, life-limiting conditions and in our elderly populations who frequently have dozens of medications to manage. As the primary carepartner to 2 disabled adults and the carepartner to a loved one with metastatic cancer, I can personally assure you that errors in medications can mean life or death and most definitely be the reason a loved one avoids the ER.</description>

In this new Think Again, NBC News Correspondent Andrew Stern dives deep into digital privacy what it really means, how we got to this point, how it impacts every facet of our lives, and how little of it we actually have.</description>

      <description>According to the results of an inspection released this month by the VAs Office of Inspector General, more than 11,000 requests for clinical orders in the new Oracle-Cerner EHR at one medical center ended up in a digital no-mans land called the unknown queue. Those overlooked orders resulted in 149 cases of patient harm two that were especially severe. In one case, the system obscured a referral for follow-up psychiatric care for a patient at risk of suicide.</description>

      <description>EHR technologies that unify seamlessly with practice management and patient engagement tools allow clinicians to deliver high-quality care consistently. When technologies are leveraged to encourage and maintain patient involvement in their own care, it&amp;rsquo;s evident in their outcomes as patients progress toward treatment goals, particularly when related to lifestyle changes and medication management.Health IT leaders must continue to invest in technologies that guide effective chronic disease management. While today&amp;rsquo;s chronic care patients are better off than those in decades past, engaged patients of the future will reap further benefits of smarter, well-integrated technologies</description>

Flo, which makes a period-tracking app once again in the spotlight, settled with the Federal Trade Commision last year over allegations it misled users about the privacy of their data. And just weeks ago, an investigation revealed major hospital systems were sending health information to Facebook, which experts said could be in violation of HIPAA.</description>

He explained how they improved their system after asking the hard questions.&amp;ldquo;We learned that not all organizations require password authorization,&amp;rdquo; he said, a fact that was met with initial skepticism and even alarm by many in the organization. But they investigated the regulatory situation and found no compelling reason to keep password authorization for most order entry needs.</description>

      <description>In January 2022, ONC issued a Request for Information (RFI) that sought public input on the ONC Health IT Certification Program and how it could incorporate standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria related to electronic prior authorization. Shortly thereafter, ONC charged the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (HITAC) with providing input and recommendations in response to this RFI. The Electronic Prior Authorization (ePA) RFI Task Force of the HITAC led consideration of the charge and developed a report and recommendations that were recently approved by the full HITAC.</description>

      <description>Among them arewhat he referred to as the Cures Act penalty enforcement gap. Namely, as Becerra explained, civil monetary penalties for not complying with information-sharing requirements have only been established for technology developers and health information networks. &amp;ldquo;It left the provider penalty up to me: the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,&amp;rdquo; he said. This is an issue, he noted, because more than 75% of the complaints submitted to ONC have been about providers and most have come from patients.</description>

      <description>But privacy experts said it shouldnt be up to IQVIA, or any other for-profit company, to decide how patients personal information is used. Who are you to decide what benefits these people? Yasnoff said. What gives you the right to be judge, jury, and executioner?To Yasnoff, the common comparison of medical data to oil a commodity to be freely traded entirely misunderstands the unique nature of data. Oil gets burned and cant be reused, but information can be reused, and so is very valuable, he said.</description>

This can include trying to figure out what to eat, or not to, when you have a particular diagnosis, have multiple comorbidities, and have a number of different medications.&#xA;One of the most common questions I hear from patients once they’ve started a particular treatment, such as chemotherapy, is, “What can I eat?</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to transform healthcare. Clinical decision support (CDS) tools are expected to streamline physician workflows while intelligently personalizing patient care, decreasing physician burden, and enhancing patient care with precision and accuracy.However, patients currently do not have access to their own intelligent summaries or data outputs. While patients do not see documentation in their medical records if their physicians are utilizing CDS outputs to guide their care, they should be able to submit a medical record request to request a copy of the CDS outputs being used at the point of care.</description>

      <description>You have heard the mantra about searching for value in healthcare. There have been dozens, hundreds, or thousands of federal policies depending on how you parse the Federal Register and entire organizations such as AHRQ, MedPAC and the CMS Center for Clinical Standards and Quality dedicated to this one goal. Why has finding value been so elusive? To a large extent, our struggle to find value dates back to 1942 when, after the Roosevelt administration froze wage hikes to forestall inflation during World War II, employers turned to healthcare benefits as a major recruiting tool.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;55% of Telehealth Providers Frustrated With OVERBLOWN Patient Expectations&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I was disappointed to read an inflammatory statement/title without any details on exactly what &amp;ldquo;overblown patient expectations&amp;rdquo; are.&#xA;Digging deeper, this report from United Health Group states: &amp;ldquo;Looking inward, providers saw similar value for themselves in telehealth. Asked how they would describe telehealth, majority of respondents (69%) used the word convenient. Another 28% described virtual care as frustrating.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sounds like we are talking about of the 28% of providers that described telehealth care as &amp;ldquo;frustrating&amp;rdquo; then 55% (of the 28%) stated that managing patient expectations for their virtual visit was their key frustration.</description>

      <description>Its going to be a busy year a really busy year. In 2022, much of the promise of the 21st Century Cures Act comes to certified health IT near you. ONC dutifully monitors industry progress towards certification to the 2015 Edition Cures Update (Cures Update), which introduces new standards and functionalities that will benefit our health care system in a variety of ways. This includes improved interoperability through secure, standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs) and the United States Core Data for Interoperability Version 1 (USCDI v1);</description>

      <description>Gaps in health IT use illustrate the inequities that unfortunately exist in our health care system, which in turn can lead to inadequate patient care, experience, and outcomes. During ONCs 2021 Tech Forum, Dr. Linda Rae Murray, the former chief medical officer at the Cook County Health &amp;amp; Hospital System, highlighted some of the health disparities she had seen firsthand while serving medically underserved patients in Chicago for more than 20 years.</description>

      <description>Patients who identify mistakes in their records could also help prevent medical errors. In a survey of 29656 patients (22% response rate) of whom 18301 had read at least 1 ambulatory note and answered questions on errors, 1 in 5 found an error and 42.3% of the patients perceived the identified errors to be serious.5 The most common errors were related to diagnoses, medical histories, medications, test results, notes on the wrong patient, and notes pertaining to the wrong side of the patients body (left vs right).</description>

      <description>February 4, 2022 is World Cancer Day. Too many patients struggle with severe barriers to accessing the care they need. These barriers and delays in care are documented to result in poor outcomes, progressive, advanced disease, as well as inhumane grief, suffering, and death.&#xA;This is unacceptable.&#xA;All patients should have the right to access the care they need to obtain a proper cancer diagnosis and treatment plan.&#xA;All patients should have the right to access the information, tools, and technology they need to make informed, educated decisions about their care.</description>

      <description>Patients diagnosed with life-altering, life-limiting diagnoses have a different outlook on life. That outlook may draw a line directly to one’s impeding mortality. Imagine having your anticipated life and time on this Earth cut drastically by an earth-shattering diagnosis, such as cancer or ALS. One’s remaining time should be maximized to the fullest. With the majority of messaging from healthcare’s stakeholders’ amplifying being patient-centered, patient first, and putting the patient at the center of their care, one would think living your best life with a diagnosis is the case.</description>

      <description>As a repository of sensitive patient information, the companys databases churn silently behind the scenes of their medical care, scooping up their most guarded secrets: the diseases they have, the drugs theyre taking, the places their bodies are broken that they havent told anyone but their doctor. The family of databases that make up MarketScan now include the records of a stunning 270 million Americans, or 82% of the population.The vast reach of MarketScan, and its immense value, is unmistakable.</description>

      <description>We identify a systematic concentration in patient sharing between hospitals in different healthcare networks that switch to the same EHR developer. The change in transfer and referral patterns occurs immediately after the focal hospital switches EHR developers, which suggests it could be due to technical attributes of the new EHR system, rather than a shift in providers preferences for hospitals based on their quality of care. Future research is needed to determine whether increased patient sharing among hospitals with the same EHR developer adversely affects patient outcomes</description>

      <description>While ONC defined Actors ashealth care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT and health information exchanges or networksin the Final Rule and published guidance on theirwebsite, there is still uncertainty as to whom the Information Blocking Rules apply. The confusion may emanate from the lack of familiarity some health care providers and health IT developers have as never having been regulated or overseen by the ONC. There also appears to be overlap between what the ONC Information Blocking Rules protect against and what and how the Office for Civil Rights protects under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</description>

      <description>The information blocking regulations at 45 CFR Part 171 began to apply to health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, health information exchanges, and health information networks on April 5, 2021, per ONCs recent interim final rule. That makes now a good time to consider stakeholders views about practices that may constitute information blocking, including the extent to which they exist. Our recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association reports on a survey of health information exchanges (HIEs) perceptions of other stakeholders practices related to information blocking.</description>

      <description>As a patient, the primary carepartner to 2 disabled adults, and a patient advocate to countless individuals, my life is inseparable from encounters in health care. From routine care, to urgent care, to emergency care, to life saving measures, to do not resuscitates, to active death care, and the mystery and heavy grief of death, no two moments are ever really alike. However, the barriers, shortcomings, and opportunities for improvement glaringly overlap and stick out over and over again.</description>

      <description>As expressed above, while there is broad acknowledgment of the merits of the Proposed Rules goals, as expressed by several commenters, there are significant concerns with the complexity that is added by the rule and the general issues related to overlapping regimes created by various departments/agencies with HHS. By way of example, OCR has created definitions for PHA and EHR and expanded individual access rights; however, the Interoperability Rules attempted to create standards regarding such access through references to the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI).</description>

The rules are expected to force a culture change across the industry, according to the top federal health IT official, Micky Tripathi. Regulators will closely monitor whether the new regulations make information more easily available to patients, including through patients mobile apps. So, what can you do to make sure that your organization is prepared to implement operational and business responses and not be vulnerable to penalties?</description>

      <description>The 21st Century CURES Act, a federal mandate that supports patients&amp;rsquo; access to and control of their medical records, recently went into effect. Health care systems are now required to share clinical notes with patients, free of charge. When patients have access to their own visit notes written by health care providers, they better remember what was discussed during the visit; feel more in control of their care; are more likely to take medications as prescribed; and can share notes with their caregivers.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/news/us-policy-requires-immediate-release-of-records-to-patients/</guid>
      <description>US healthcare organisations may choose to comply with the rule in a way that helps ensure patients know about their enhanced right to access and use their health information for empowerment and engagement, or they may simply keep quiet about it and hope patients dont notice their new rights. Choosing to keep quiet would be a mistake. Full sharing and transparency of personal health information should strengthen patient-clinician communication, raise health literacy, promote self-management, enhance teamwork, and increase trust.</description>

COVID-19 was surging in New Jersey. Hospitals in Bergen and Essex counties were crowded. But this patient needed me at her bedside. I knew all of the details and intricacies of her care and medical history. I grabbed all of her medical records in a binder, grabbed a mask, and met her at the emergency room.</description>

      <description>Barriers to Access Overview: Obtaining Medical Records from Practices that are Closed Physician practices close for several reasons. Physicians may merge with another practice or hospital system. They may sell or close their practice for financial reasons, such as in the event of the negative financial consequences incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians may retire. They may get sick and pass away. In short, while there are numerous reasons that a practice may close, patients and their families may encounter significant barriers to obtaining medical records if a physicians practice closes and there isnt a robust plan in place to provide patients easy access to their records.</description>

      <description>Today, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) passed a final rule that promotes data sharing, patient access to health information, coordinated care, and interoperability to streamline the prior authorization process.The rule is the next phase of CMS interoperability rulemaking, aimed at improving data exchange while reducing provider and patient burden.The CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization rule will allow certain payers, providers, and patients to have electronic access to pending and active prior authorization decisions.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/news/a-path-toward-further-clinical-and-administrative-data-integration/</guid>
      <description>Today, patients, caregivers, and clinicians struggle with information exchange barriers due to the separation of clinical and administrative data. The effect of this is especially clear in the case of prior authorization, where inefficient information exchange can significantly delay or obstruct patient access to treatment and payment for healthcare services. Clinicians also report that finding and exchanging information for prior authorization is a major source of burden. To structure its recommendations, the ICAD Task Force developed a series of guiding principles to make sure the recommendations addressed the gaps between the present and ideal state.</description>

      <description>HIPAA grants individuals the right of access and the right to inspect one’s medical and health information within designated record sets maintained by HIPAA covered entities.&#xA;The right to inspect one’s medical records is not frequently discussed.&#xA;Why would someone ask to inspect their or their loved one’s medical record? What if you don’t want an actual copy of the records, but you just need to see them?&#xA;In the real world, the story is always the same.</description>

      <description>This final rule, in turn, flows from CMSs MyHealthEData initiative, which focused on giving patients easy and direct access to their medical data. The agency has attempted to not only make patient health data more accessible, but has also worked to educate patients on the value of engaging with that data.All well and good. However, while this stepwise approach to expanding health data interoperability seems relatively sound, particularly given that patients were given a seat at the data buffet table, one shouldnt forget that there are still some serious interoperability issues remaining unresolved.</description>

      <description>Moscovitch pointed at the information blocking regulations that are a part of the 21st Century Cures Act to help this issue. If certain demographic information is not reported, fines of up to $1 million could occur.The Biden administration could use this authority to require that health care providers include complete demographic data, such as contact information, when ordering tests from labs, Moscovitch recommended. Thats critical because labs cannot share complete data with public health authorities if they have not received it in the first place.</description>

This is a record number of exchanges for the EHR vendor, Epic said, and that level of performance will be necessary as the industry stares down a likely influx of COVID-19 cases.</description>

      <description>In a culture, society, and democracy that protects freedom of speech, we do a terrible job of talking about the one inevitable thing that unifies us all: death. Openly speaking about death is a rarity and often taboo. One word of advice goes out to doctors:&#xA;There are thousands and thousands of patients across the nation who are sick enough to die and don’t know. Diagnoses are delivered without an explanation of the severity and gravity of the situation.</description>

      <description>Patients filed class-action complaints against the Mayo Clinic this past week. They areaccusing the system of violating the Minnesota Health Records Act. Mayo Clinic said in a news release in October that a former employee had inappropriately accessed the health records of more than 1,600 patients. Now, multiple patients are seeking to have a class-action case declared against the clinic.According to a complaint filed last week in Olmsted County District Court, Mayo Clinic told plaintiff Olga Ryabchuk that the potentially accessible data included her name, demographic information, birth date, medical record number and clinical notes.</description>

      <description>While there have been many events on interoperability and data sharing, whats unique here is our focus on the BUSINESS rationale for health data sharing.The bases of competition in healthcare are shifting to competing on quality, cost, and patient experience. This shift creates a business imperative to share information, not to hoard it.Hoarding data is not only bad for business but can be catastrophic in a crisis.Data of all kinds has an important role in public health, logistics management, and the healthcare supply chain.</description>

      <description>When you have access to a comprehensive history, people are much more likely to find errors in their data, said Pollak, who is the co-founder and chief architect at the Commons Project, which in 2019 built CommonHealth to let Android users access their patient portals on mobile devices.There are scholarly papers showing that people have better patient engagement portability between providers, he pointed out. Certainly, we&amp;rsquo;re at a time when you, in spite of the health information exchange and some of the other platforms, it&amp;rsquo;s still sadly possible to show up somewhere and not have your health data with you.</description>

      <description>Adverse drug events (ADE) are a leading cause of patient harm and death worldwide. Almost 70% of patients&amp;rsquo; medication histories noted upon patient admission to hospital have at least one error, with 30 – 80% of patients having a discrepancy between the medicines ordered in hospital and those they take at home. Here is one patient example of the dangers and frustrations of poor medication reconciliation.&#xA;In preparation for an upcoming surgery, a patient &amp;amp; their carepartner followed up with all the patient&amp;rsquo;s care team and the patient&amp;rsquo;s primary care physician (PCP) to discuss the patient&amp;rsquo;s upcoming surgery &amp;amp; medications.</description>

      <description>Current clinical notes often attempt to check off many requirements related to reimbursement: documentation of current medications, documentation of organ system review, documentation of test results, documentation of fulfillment of performance measures, and, somewhere in the mix, an assessment and plan. Social history is often relegated to simply updating smoking status.&#xA;But as Blease and colleagues point out in their article (1), the cloak that effectively covers many notes will be lifted on 2 November 2020, when the 21st Century Cures Act is implemented and patients are to have ready access to their medical record, including the clinical notes (2).</description>

      <description>What should patients do when their doctors office closes, and they need a copy of their medical records? This is especially challenging when a doctor may not have had an EHR, as is the case with many independent practices as well as more rural settings. On September 26, 2020, a tweet from Cait DesRoches, Executive Director of OpenNotes, inquired about how a family member may get access to medical records from her physicans practice that closed, triggering a robust conversation that led to the realization that patients and families are not well informed in these circumstances.</description>

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ensures that personal health information (PHI) is not wrongfully used, improperly accessed, or shared. Did you know that HIPAA also protects an individual’s right to privacy for up to 50 years after their death?&#xA;There are many reasons why loved ones may need access to a deceased individual’s medical records.</description>

      <description>In the rush to launch solutions to maintain trials during COVID-19 are sponsors at risk for leaving patient input behind?While patient-centricity is an overused term with no real definition, does the current environment allow us the opportunity to rethink how patients are engaged for clinical trials, from trial design to access and participation?Can we create a new more permanent solution where the patient is at the heart of the trial?Join us as a panel of experts who will discuss how this could be done and what the industry should consider, with an actionable plan for implementation.</description>

      <description>Errors in electronic health records (EHRs) are common.1,2 At least half of EHRs may contain an error, many related to medications.2-8 Overburdened practitioners may import inaccurate medication lists, propagate other erroneous information electronically by copying and pasting older parts of the record, or enter erroneous examination findings.2,8,9 EHRs may also lack critical information (errors of omission) because of limited interoperability among health care sites.10 Among primary care physicians sharing notes with patients, 26% anticipated that patients would find nontrivial errors.</description>

McGraw asked. That I think is an open question that can be difficult to solve. But nevertheless, you have to have a way for people to be able to remotely request their information, because you cant require an in-person visit. The guidance makes this very clear.</description>

      <description>Kevin Chaney, MGS; Teresa Zayas Cabn; Josh Mandel, M.D. and Stephanie Devaney | May 18, 2020&#xA;Electronic health record (EHR) systems store incredibly rich data about individual patients, but historically, individuals have been unable to access this information easily and share it for research. However, use of patients data could accelerate scientific discovery and progress toward precision medicine. Permitting patients to connect and share their data with researcherswhile maintaining the security and privacy of those datais just one of the many benefits to the research community of the ONCs Cures Act Final Rule released in March 2020.</description>

      <description>All three bills focus on the type of health data that falls outside the scope of the federal privacy law known as HIPAA, which only applies to entities like hospitals and clinics and their business associates. The architects of the law, first passed in 1996 and amended slightly over the years, could not have imagined the current reality in which public health agencies are developing apps to track coronavirus patients and their contacts using technology built by Google and Apple.</description>

      <description>Heres a small sampling of the problems caused by the lack of interoperability. All of that adds complexity and cost to an already overburdened health-care system.Physicians often find themselves ordering duplicate tests, which is a hassle for patients and a major source of unnecessary costs.Patients might see delays in care as their doctors try to aggregate their medical information.It keeps patients feeling captive in a system, because its a burden for them to go to another hospital that uses a different medical record system.</description>

      <description>In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, the study by Latulipe et al3 found that only two-thirds of the US hospitals they surveyed offered adult patients the option of granting portal access to a care partner, and among hospitals that did, the process for obtaining proxy credentials was often difficult and time consuming. Moreover, their findings highlight a long-standing practice that has troublesome implications for patient privacy: personnel in almost half of the hospitals suggested to the study&amp;rsquo;s interviewers (who acted as secret shoppers) that the care partner use the patient&amp;rsquo;s credentials to review health records.</description>

      <description>A big change was the reimbursement of audio only telehealth which also applies retroactively to March 1, 2020:CMS previously announced that Medicare would pay for certain services conducted by audio-only telephone between beneficiaries and their doctors and other clinicians. Now, CMS is broadening that list to include many behavioral health and patient education services. CMS is also increasing payments for these telephone visits to match payments for similar office and outpatient visits.</description>

      <description>Specifically, the final rules call for payers to provide healthcare data to patients through the use of FHIR-based APIs, as well as using a similar methodology to make provider directories available to patients. The CMS rule mentions two implementation guides developed by the Da Vinci Project &amp;ldquo;that support the policies that we have finalized in this rule,&amp;rdquo; she said.&amp;ldquo;While these implementation guides are not requirements of the rule, we believe they will significantly support and improve the implementation of these APIs on the part of payers,&amp;rdquo; Mugge added.</description>

This proposed rule would outline the civil money penalties OIG can enforce against those in healthcare who are doing what ONC has termed Information Blocking.In other words, this is the proposed enforcement of the 21st Century Cures Act Information Blocking provisions. You can read the proposed information blocking rule from OIG that is published on the Federal Register.</description>

      <description>For the last 5 years, telemedicine has been predicted to be the key to transforming health care. COVID19 gave the understudy a coveted, centerstage role, removing more red tape in a matter of weeks than in the last 5 years.&#xA;With many states practicing social distancing and sheltering at home, caregivers, patients, and carepartners needed to rapidly pivot and adjust to ensure continuity of care.&#xA;In hotspot areas, such as in NJ and NY, health care providers escalated telemedicine implementation efforts to deploy virtual care on the scale of weeks.</description>

      <description>The fear of violating HIPAA, as with many such fears, was not necessarily well placed. A CBTS is an extension of operations to any number of healthcare providers, including hospitals, physician groups, and pharmacies. The testing would be a healthcare service that is part of operations. From that perspective, a CBTS is similar to setting up a new office. As such, it seems that the attention garnered by COVID-19 was just thrown up as a barrier to getting needed care.</description>

      <description>A medical resident who treated her believes she would have gotten better care if she spoke English.In the ER, where no one has enough time, particularly now, the resident said he could tell that no one wanted to work with an interpreter to take down the womans medical history. He placed his phone on the womans shoulder and dialed the interpreter service on speakerphone. Between the N95 mask covering his mouth and the helmet covering his ears, it was difficult to speak clearly and to hear.</description>

      <description>Patient advocates have developed strong partnerships with the clinical and research communities. When the stakes for accessing reliable information are high, those with serious illnesses are particularly invested in disseminating trusted information. This doesnt mean we are immune to misinformation, but given our high risk for Covid-19 vulnerability, we recognize an added layer of diligence to follow our clinical partners in sharing trusted information. Grace Cordovano, an oncology patient advocate, displays the strength of partnership with patients and clinicians in this LinkedIn post, calling for resources.</description>

The numbers are grossly underreported. I know for a fact that weve had three deaths in one county where only one is listed on the website, the doctor said.</description>

      <description>When we rung in the New Year, many called the decade upon us the New Roaring 20’s. March 2020 required a seatbelt buckled in tight.&#xA;Coronavirus became a regular part of our daily vocabulary. Positive cases began to rise on the West and East coast. For the 1st time in 58 years, HIMSS was cancelled due to the coronavirus. The heavily anticipated rules were released.

We will also consider the health inequities that go along with tech solutions as well, and considerations for how to co-design future health innovations. And we would be remiss if we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about the current global health concerns and how vulnerable populations hear you when you say &amp;ldquo;only the high risk should worry.</description>

      <description>Current patient medical records requests workflows at health systems, hospitals, cancer centers, and physician practices pose significant barriers to patient continuity of care, patient safety, patient outcomes, and, most importantly, trust.&#xA;Our health care ecosystem loves to boast about &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;placing the patient at the center of their care&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;empowering patients&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;enabling consumerism&amp;rdquo;. The problem is that many healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) do a remarkably poor job with the most visible of patient services: initiating, tracking, and resolving medical records requests.</description>

However, it doesnt share a compelling case for how theyve really solved the healthcare interoperability problem. Remember that the problem is not a technical one, but a business one. Does a slicker interface do anything to solve the business problem here? Not even close.&#xA;Read on healthcareittoday.com</description>

      <description>Its important to understand that the disingenuous efforts by certain private actors to use privacy, vital as it is, as a pretext for holding patient data hostage is an embarrassment to the industry, said Verma in an oblique nod to the recent pushback the agency has received from Epic Systems. Access to ones data can be a matter of life and death, and this Administration will not waver in ensuring that patients enjoy full ownership of it when they need it.</description>

      <description>In summary:&#xA;HIPAAs rules were not designed to address privacy risks introduced by widespread personal information collection and use in the modern digital ecosystem. HIPAAs rules were designed to support information flows within the health care system and allow for broad uses and disclosures of data by both covered entities and business associates without the need to obtain patient consent. HIPAA is leaky it expressly allows covered entities and business associates to share data outside of HIPAA, including selling de-identified data, without patient consent.</description>

      <description>It seems that the definition of a barbarian is anyone who aims to get patient records under the current laws and the explicit direction of the patient. The opposite of barbarians, whoever they may be within the gates of HIPAA, are able to get patient records without consent or accounting for disclosures by asserting Treatment, Payment, or Operations as well as the pretense of de-identification. Meanwhile, these HIPAA non-barbarians are able to sell off the machine learning and other medical science teachings as trade secret intellectual property in the form of computer decision support and other for-profit algorithms.</description>

There are clear indicationsfrom a highly publicized Ciitizen study and otherwisethat access is an ongoing problem. At the same time, there is a sense in the regulated community that access violations are small potatoes.&#xA;Read on news.bloomberglaw.com</description>

      <description>Data blocking and lack of transparency are 2 of the biggest detriments to not only patient empowerment and engagement, but also to patient care, safety, the patient experience, and consumerism.&#xA;Point of care is in a state of dynamic metamorphosis. Gone are the days where doctors only know best. There is a clear shift from paternalistic to participatory medicine, where patients are not only demanding the driver’s seat to their care, but are also hitting the accelerator and driving through any barriers in their way.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year 2020! With a new year and new decade upon us, we’d like to tell you the story of how Unblock Health was born.&#xA;Once upon a time, at HIT Expo 2018 in sunny New Orleans, a board-certified patient advocate and a health IT thought leader got to talking about patient unmet needs. The advocate fervently emphasized the struggles patients and their loved ones faced due to lack of interoperability, rampant data blocking, and little to no transparency while trying to navigate their life-altering diagnoses.</description>

      <description>AI developers cull electronic health records because they hold huge amounts of detailed data, Cho said. But those developers often arent aware that theyre building atop a deeply broken system. Electronic health records were developed for billing, not patient care, and are filled with mistakes or missing data.A KHN investigation published in March found sometimes life-threatening errors in patients medication lists, lab tests and allergies.&#xA;Read on scientificamerican.com</description>

      <description>Glucose monitors and insulin pumps are, effectively, prostheses: artificial organs that are basically parts of your body. Abbott&amp;rsquo;s position is that they own part of your body and you can only use it in ways that don&amp;rsquo;t upset their shareholders. This is an outrageous position. I mean, forget all the bullshit about whether your blood is copyrighted and if so, by whom &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re saying that your organs are copyrighted works whose usage is subject to the whims of a white-shoe law firm that is prepared to delete your code and send you a bowel-looseningly terrifying legal threat any time you dare to assert your bodily autonomy.</description>

      <description>Given that the patient record request process can take time, it is of great benefit to access ones data prior to an urgent health need. Additionally, healthy individuals may also benefit from correcting errors in their medical record before a health issue occurs. Among individuals that accessed their medical record online, almost one in 10 requested a correction to information in their record. Explaining these benefits to healthy individuals may increase usage of online medical records.</description>

      <description>Focus on interoperability for health data systems has increased recently given multiple proposed Department of Health and Human Services regulations addressing how health data is shared. Healthcare providers are a primary source of health data and should be aware of how to prepare for these new regulations. While each hospital has its unique approach to managing its health data and sharing of that information, there are actions all hospitals can take to prepare for heightened expectations for health data interoperability.</description>

      <description>Special interests and congressional inaction blocked efforts to track the safety of electronic medical records, leaving patients at risk.&#xA;One study uncovered more than 9,000 patient safety reports tied to EHR problems at three pediatric hospitals over a five-year period.&#xA;Allegations of EHR-related injuries or other flaws have surfaced in the courts. KHN/Fortune examined more than two dozen such cases, such as a California woman who mistakenly had most of her left leg amputated because the EHR sent another patients pathology report indicating cancer to her medical file.</description>

      <description>Personal data is aggregated, packaged and sold every day without the knowledge or full consent of the subject consumers, and it has been exploited and abused to the detriment of those consumers. However, overly stringent privacy rules regarding health data could impede timely care and patient safety, writes Piers Nash, former director at the Center for Data Intensive Science, who suggests a Hippocratic oath for using and sharing personal health data.</description>

      <description>In the wake of the report detailing the Ascension-Google, Project Nightingale, patients are left wondering what the consequences of this, and other similar tech giant partnerships, will be for their near and long-term future. Patients fear being discriminated against, suffering a reputation loss, the risk of losing employment opportunities, and being classified in a manner that makes insurance unaffordable or potentially inaccessible.&#xA;There are legitimate concerns about the commercialization of biased AI predictive decision-making algorithms that may negatively impact their care as has been recently reported.</description>
