In 2021, the HLTH Foundation- a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that promotes equity, inclusion, and opportunity in healthcare, strategically partnered with Ipsos- a global market research and advisory firm, to explore the concept of techquity. Together, the teams conducted exploratory industry and patient-focused research for the purpose of bringing attention to the relationship between health equity and health technology and identifying opportunities for the industry to collaborate on addressing techquity gaps -which resulted in an introductory Path to Techquity'' report and patient ethnography video (published March 2022). The research partnership expanded in 2022 with growing interest and support from key industry advisors, and by early 2023, the Techquity for Health Coalition was formed with a mission to assimilate health equity considerations into healthcare technology innovation and data practices across the industry (See Exhibit 1)\*. As of March 2023, the Coalition Advisory Committee includes representatives from 18 additional organizations across the industry (not including HLTH Foundation or Ipsos), and will continue to grow its membership in order to build for broad and diverse representation.
