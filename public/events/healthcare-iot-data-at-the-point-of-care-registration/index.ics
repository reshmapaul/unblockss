SUMMARY:Healthcare IoT Data at the Point of Care-Registration
DESCRIPTION:IoT is here to stay. Smaller devices and more intelligent sensors, combined with the advent of 5G, are ushering in a new era of patient-generated data. Intelligence at the edge also opens the door to distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) and analytics. Join us for this amazing discussion on Healthcare IoT Data at the Point of Care to learn how to build out your Edge and IoT ecosystem both at the hospital and at the patients home. In this webinar we will discuss:- How organizations can apply distributed analytics to create integrated patient care from the hospital to the home.- How should cybersecurity tools be incorporated to avoid unauthorized access.- How security blueprints can be designed proactively rather than being an afterthought.
