On April 25, 2023, Casey Quinlan died peacefully after a long journey with metastatic cancer. The tributes, tweets, and social media posts poured in. I wanted to find a place to capture them. So here’s my attempt at a “Collections & Recollections of Casey”.

I’ll never forget one of my 1st conversations with Casey at MedMo16 in New York City. When I met Casey in person, I had to ask about the QR code she had [tattooed on her chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jISrpXAcUHg). She discussed her protest against the lack of data liquidity and patient data rights. I made sure to pick my jaw up off the floor when she was done sharing her story.

I was in awe. This woman was the real deal and was clearly not messing around.

To say Casey was inspiring was an understatement. Her sense of humor and snark were unparalleled. Casey was a true force to be reckoned with. Her stories were captivating. Her spirit was bold and the essence of GSD. Her laugh, smile, and that mischievous twinkle in her eye are forever unforgettable.

After that event in NYC, Casey took me under her rock star wing. She became a mentor and sounding board for all things patient advocacy, questions on patient access, surveillance capitalism, the business of data aggregation, and guiding me towards a stronger, firmer, less apologetic voice. 

Casey was the epitome of #SheForShe. She was a fierce supporter of my patient advocacy work and frequently engaged in LinkedIn and Twitter discussions, elevating and amplifying my work. [Her work at the Light Collective](https://lightcollective.org/our-people/) was clearly one of her pride and joys. How grateful I am to have had the opportunity to collaborate on content, podcasts, and webinars and much-needed patient advocacy problem and FU cancer venting sessions over Signal. The conversations and laughs over dinners or drinks after conferences are now the many moments that mattered.

The void left behind is tremendous, surreal, and gutting. I’m sure many feel the magnitude of Casey's death. I’m holding space for you.

Below is a collection of all things Casey that I was able to find in the days after she was stolen from us too soon by cancer. If there are other items people find, please don’t hesitate to reach out and I’ll continue to update Collections of Casey.
