The writing is on the wall: Interoperability is coming, whether or not your organization is ready for it. In 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (or CMS) published the [Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule](https://www.cms.gov/blog/interoperability-and-connected-health-care-system) to progress interoperability and health information access for all stakeholders.

Although the rule was supposed to go into effect [January 1, 2021](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/interoperability/index#:~:text=The%20Interoperability%20and%20Patient%20Access,they%20can%20best%20use%20it.), enforcement of the Patient Access and Provider Directory provisions was delayed six months, while the payer-to-payer provisionÂ was left unenforced until a new amendment was released. So, where does this leave us? How close are we, as an industry, to achieving interoperability?
