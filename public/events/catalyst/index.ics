SUMMARY:Catalyst
DESCRIPTION:Free Live Web Event
June 10, 2021
12:00 pm - 1:45 pm EDT
Virtual Event
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the gaps that can occur when the patient voice isnt heard or integrated into the delivery of care. Patients are demanding change in how they receive and consume health care, and providers are responding. Join NEJM Catalyst for the second event in our free, four-part virtual series on how care delivery will change in the coming decade: Health Care 2030: Patients &amp; Consumers. Our international panel of health care leaders and experts will share their insights about how to center care delivery on patient engagement, equity, and empowerment.
Health care leaders, clinicians, researchers, patient advocates, and everyone interested in the future of care delivery are invited to join this fast-paced event. Our interactive agenda features health system executives sharing tips for hearing the patient voice, a diabetes patient who helmed an entrepreneurial startup focused on chronic disease care, a researcher examining the importance of equitable access and quality of care, a German health system CEO and a respected academic on the power of patient-reported outcomes, and a live Q&amp;A.
Register for this free event and learn:
How Covid-19 has changed patient and consumer expectations for care and how to meet these new demands.
The steps health care organizations can take to hear and integrate the patient voice in care delivery.
How to recognize gaps in health equity, why they matter, and what can be done to address them.
Why thinking of patients as consumers can lead to improved quality of care.
How to deploy patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to maximize impact on care delivery.
