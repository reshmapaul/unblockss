ONC Working Session: Patient Identity and Matching

Monday, June 1, 2020, 9:30 AM - 4:30 PM ET

Join us for a working session on patient identity and patient matching. We invite individuals and organizations to provide input and insight into existing challenges and promising innovations in patient identity and matching. This feedback will inform ONCs report to Congress on evaluating the effectiveness of technical and operational methods that improve identification of patients.Attendees may request an opportunity to lead a brief presentation during the virtual session. As noted above, presentations should focus on challenges and innovations in patient identity and matching. If youd like to present during the virtual session, please be sure to register by May 22nd. If you have Powerpoint slides, you will need to submit them to ONC by Wednesday, May 27th. Please note: we will only be able to accommodate a limited number of presentations, and will make every effort to include diverse representation from across the healthcare sector. ONC is soliciting feedback from all attendees, presentations are not required. Attendees will have the opportunity to submit comments during and after the session.  Questions about the event may be directed to Identity.ONC@hhs.gov.
